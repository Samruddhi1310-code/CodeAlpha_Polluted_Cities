#Project Overview-

This project focuses on visualizing air pollution levels of Indian cities using air quality data.

The dataset includes pollution parameters such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and AQI.

Two bar charts are used to identify the most polluted and cleanest cities based on AQI values.

A pie chart represents the overall distribution of air quality categories across cities.

These visualizations help in understanding pollution patterns at a glance.

The project demonstrates how data visualization simplifies complex environmental data.

Tools used include Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook.

#Dataset Description

The dataset contains air quality information for Indian cities with the following parameters:

1.City – Name of the city

2.PM2.5 – Particulate Matter ≤ 2.5 micrometers

3.PM10 – Particulate Matter ≤ 10 micrometers

4.NO₂ – Nitrogen Dioxide

5.SO₂ – Sulphur Dioxide

6.CO – Carbon Monoxide

7.AQI – Air Quality Index

8.AQI is used as the primary metric to determine pollution severity.

#Visualizations Created

1.Top 10 Most Polluted Cities (Bar Chart)

Displays cities with the highest AQI values

Helps identify cities with critical air pollution levels

2. Top 10 Cleanest Cities (Bar Chart)

Shows cities with lowest AQI values

Highlights areas with better air quality

3. AQI Category Distribution (Pie Chart)

Categorizes cities into:

Good

Moderate

Poor

Very Poor

Shows the overall air quality distribution across cities

#Tools & Technologies Used

-Python

-Pandas

-Matplotlib

-Jupyter Notebook

#Insights

Several cities fall under high pollution categories

Only a limited number of cities maintain good air quality

Most cities lie in the moderate pollution range, indicating a need for better pollution control measure
